### FPL
I have used data from the 19/20 premier league season to work out the value of players in the 20/21 Fantasy Premier League game. I've made two different metrics. Value/90 uses the players points scored in the 19/20 season to show how much value each player has. The second metric uses expected goals and expected assists to aquire a players xPoints from attacking returns. These xPoints are used to find xValue/90.
